       <p> Yeah Well </p> 
       <h2>[Verse 1] </h2> 
       <p> I got a bone to pick like roses (Roses) I ain't feelin' broken no more Balled a fist, they gossipin', I notice Talkin' shit, I wander through the motives Wonder who the fuck we're supposed to be I ain't worried now 'til I leave I'm just tryna ride and feel the breeze With somethin' bad beside n' next to me Wind in my face, don't stop now when it feels so great You can run 'til you slip on the sidewalk And the same bone that you picked gon' break, that's a motif (That's a motif) Yeah, when it's comin' right back, so familiar, never been realer Never felt so damn good where I'm at I don't know what it's all about Runnin' through too many thoughts to count (That's way better) Still ain't addin' up, I'll let you know when I've had enough, yeah Yeah, well </p> 
        <h2> [Pre-Chorus] </h2> 
        <p> I'd put some money on forever, but I (Hey) Don't like to gamble on the weather, so I Just watch while The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, I know Hey, well </p> 
        <h2> [Chorus] </h2>
        <p> These are my wings, these are my wings, yeah These are my wings, yeah, well </p>

        <p> Movin' so fast, the clock look slow (Slow) Water my seeds 'til the flower just grow, yeah Love so much that my heart get broke I don't really know how the normal shit go, so I guess I just play it by ear, silence is all that I hear Listenin' close as I can Growin' up (One, two, three), jump Nobody holdin' my hand, no Trust is a problem, never knew how Yeah, that's why I just keep to myself Get what I need, then I'll be out (Please tell me) Who can surf the universe with me? Lucifer is human, so are we All I ever want is what I need And that don't include your time and company Follow me, we on the up and up Remember when I owed a hundred bucks? Now, I look around like, "What the fuck?" If you don't fuck with me, you fuckin' up </p>
        <h2> [Pre-Chorus] </h2>
        <p> Now I need to watch my temper, so I Don't ever gamble on the weather, but I Just watch while the The sun is shinin', I can look at the horizon The walls keep gettin' wider, I just hope I never find 'em, no, no Yeah, well </p>
